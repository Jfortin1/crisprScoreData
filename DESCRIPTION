Description:
    Provides an interface to access pre-trained models for on-target
    and off-target gRNA activity prediction algorithms implemented in
    the crisprScore package. Pre-trained model data are stored in 
    the ExperimentHub database. Users should consider using
    the crisprScore package directly to use and load the pre-trained
    models.
